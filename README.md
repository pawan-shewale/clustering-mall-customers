### Project Overview

 Clusterring using K-means and plotting hierarchyusing dendroram


### Learnings from the project

 Clusterring unsupervised Machine learning techniques


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Elbow Plot using K-Means and finding best model


### Challenges faced

 Elbow plot using normal method is difficult than KElbowVisualizer (from yellowbrick.cluster) which was not working on platform and need to be installed first in env which is used.


### Additional pointers

 NA
